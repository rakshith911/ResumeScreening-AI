# AI-Powered Resume Screening System

A BERT-based classifier for automatically labeling resumes as Software Engineer (SWE), Machine Learning Engineer (MLE), or Data Scientist (DS). Built for reproducibility and ease of use in Google Colab, this project demonstrates the full workflow from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and inference.


# Features
1. BERT-based Text Classification using HuggingFace Transformers.

2. Synthetic Data Support: Works with GPT-generated or real resumes.

3. Balanced Multi-Class Support: Handles SWE, MLE, and Data Science roles.

4. Notebook-Ready: All steps are tailored for easy implementation in Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts.

5. End-to-End Pipeline: Includes preprocessing, training, evaluation, and inference.

6. Easy Model Saving/Loading: Save and reload trained models for future predictions.
